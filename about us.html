  <h1> About us </h1> 
  <hr>
 
 <p> Rumah Nurul Iman was founded by Encik Khairul Anuar bin Mohmad Razi. Established with the hope of helping underprivileged children such as orphans, the poor, the neglected and the oppressed, by providing shelter and the opportunity to get a perfect education. In the early stages of its establishment, Rumah Nurul Iman was managed by a committee. The committee has appointed En. Khairul Anuar bin Mohmad Razi as the Manager/Supervisor of the hostel. He is the person in charge of all matters relating to the operation of the hostel except in matters relating to assets and finances. then on October 9, 2006 Mr. Khairul Anuar has officially registered the Nurul Iman Orphans and Poor Child Care Center as a sole proprietorship. On the 12th of October, Mr. Khairul Anuar has made a sworn statement to confirm that the Nurul Iman Orphans and Poor Child Care Center conducts activities for free. On 30 June 2011 PERTUBUHAN KEBAJIKAN KASIH NURUL IMAN NEGERI PERAK was officially established under the Registrar of Societies. This establishment is to streamline the administration and fulfill the requirements of the Social Welfare Department</p>
